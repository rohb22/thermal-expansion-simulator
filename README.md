This project presents a thermal expansion simulation developed using the Godot game engine with C++. The user can input all necessary parameters, such as the coefficient of thermal expansion, initial temperature, and the length of the material. Based on these inputs, the program dynamically simulates the expansion or contraction of the material, offering a visual representation of how objects behave under varying thermal conditions.

Weâ€™ve selected Godot because it is compatible with C++ via extensions and fits within our expertise as computer engineering students at Colegio de Muntinlupa, where C++ was a core component of our first-year curriculum. Godot's built-in assets also facilitate easy visualization, saving time and allowing us to focus on delivering a smooth and interesting user experience. By integrating C++ into Godot, we maintain both the performance efficiency of native programming and the flexibility of game development tools.

Thermal expansion was chosen as the focus of our simulation due to its ease of visualization and clear comprehension, making it an ideal topic to introduce fundamental physics principles. The program is user-friendly, capable of generating precise data, and useful for student experiments by providing real-time feedback and data visualization. Ultimately, this project serves as both an educational tool and a demonstration of the practical applications of C++ in simulation development.
